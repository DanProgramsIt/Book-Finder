# Book-Finder

Hello and welcome to Book-Finder!


## Description
Book Finder is a full-stack MERN app that uses the Google Books API to search for any book title your interested in. The search results are displayed with book title's, an image and description.
You can signup with a username, email and password. When logged in you can save your favorite books to display in your saved books page. The saved books are persistent and will still show up when you log out and return to the app. If you like you can also remove a book from your save list as well, simple hit the "Delete this book!".
 

Please checkout my deployed app! **[Deployed App](https://challenge-21.herokuapp.com/)**
